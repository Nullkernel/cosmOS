# OS

A work-in-progress operating system repository.  
Built from scratch in **C + Assembly**, focusing on kernel fundamentals, boot process, and low-level architecture.

## Overview

This is a minimal hobby operating system project aiming to explore **core OS design and implementation**, including:
- Bootloader and early startup
- Custom kernel code
- Memory management
- Scheduling and basic hardware interaction

This repo is a personal project and learning ground for OS development.

## Build

To build the OS locally:

```sh
make
```
